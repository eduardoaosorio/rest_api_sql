# rest_api_sql

Techdegree Project 5

## Description

REST API built using Express, Node.js, SQLite and the SQL ORM Sequelize.

This API provides a way to administer a database containing information about users and courses. Users can interact with the database to create new courses, retrieve information on existing courses, and update or delete existing courses. To make changes to the database, users are required to log in so the API will also allow users to create a new account or retrieve information on an existing account.
